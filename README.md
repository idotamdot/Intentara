“Map your lineage. Ignite your spark.” or “Where intention becomes visible.”
# Intentara — Human Intention Map App

**Map your lineage. Ignite your spark.**

Intentara is a living dashboard that visualizes human intention as a dynamic graph.  
Every action becomes a node, every connection a motif, every lineage a story.  
It transforms data into ceremony — revealing resonance, persistence, breadth, velocity, and trust.
