# Agent Guidelines

## Welcome, Contributors!

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Intentara. This document provides guidelines for agents, contributors, and collaborators working on this project.

## Project Vision

Intentara is designed to make intentions visible and actionable. Our goal is to help users:
- Map the lineage of their goals and aspirations
- Track progress with clarity and purpose
- Transform abstract intentions into concrete actions
- Visualize the path from where they are to where they want to be

## Development Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Clarity**: Code and features should be intuitive and easy to understand
2. **Purpose**: Every feature should serve the user's intention-tracking needs
3. **Simplicity**: Favor simple, elegant solutions over complex ones
4. **User-Centered**: Always consider the user experience in decision-making

### Code Standards

- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code
- Follow established coding conventions for the language/framework being used
- Include comments for complex logic or non-obvious implementations
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

## Contribution Workflow

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes thoroughly
6. Commit with clear, descriptive messages
7. Push to your fork
8. Open a pull request

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages that describe what and why:

```
Good: Add intention hierarchy visualization feature
Bad: Update files

Good: Fix date sorting bug in timeline view
Bad: Bug fix
```

### Pull Requests

- Provide a clear description of what your PR does
- Reference any related issues
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Ensure all tests pass
- Be responsive to feedback and questions

## Communication

### Asking Questions

- Check existing issues and documentation first
- Provide context when asking questions
- Be specific about what you're trying to accomplish

### Reporting Bugs

Include:
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, browser, version, etc.)

### Suggesting Features

- Explain the use case and benefit
- Consider how it aligns with project vision
- Be open to discussion and alternative approaches

## Code Review

### As a Reviewer

- Be constructive and respectful
- Explain the reasoning behind suggestions
- Acknowledge good work
- Focus on the code, not the person

### As a Reviewee

- Be open to feedback
- Ask questions if suggestions are unclear
- Don't take criticism personally
- Learn from the review process

## Testing

- Ensure existing tests pass
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Consider both positive and negative test scenarios

## Documentation

- Update documentation when adding features
- Keep README.md current
- Document API changes
- Include inline code documentation

## Agent-Specific Guidelines
